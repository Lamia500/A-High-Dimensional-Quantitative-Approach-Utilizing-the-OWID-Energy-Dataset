# Stochastic Multivariate Regression for Predictive Analysis of Renewable Energy Consumption

### **Overview**
This project presents a high-dimensional quantitative approach to predict national-level electricity generation using the **OWID global energy dataset**. The research involves a rigorous empirical analysis of **30 regression algorithms**—including linear models, tree-based ensembles, and instance-based learners—to optimize sustainable energy systems and grid stability.

### **Key Highlights**
* **Model Performance:** Achieved an exceptional **$R^2$ of 0.9994** and a low **RMSE of 23.95** using an optimized k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) model.
* **Superior Algorithms:** Identified that tree-based ensemble models (Extra Trees, Random Forest) and instance-based learners outperform conventional SVM and linear responses.
* **Data-Driven Planning:** Developed a feasible planning tool for policymakers to coordinate traditional and nontraditional energy sources with macroeconomic indicators.

### **Methodology & Pipeline**
1. **Data Acquisition:** Utilized the Our World in Data (OWID) global energy dataset containing energy, economic, and demographic variables.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Integrated key predictors such as **GDP per capita**, **Population**, and multi-source energy consumption (biofuel, solar, wind, fossil fuels, etc.).
3. **Preprocessing:** Employed linear interpolation for missing entries and Min-Max normalization.
4. **Optimization:** Systematic hyperparameter tuning through Grid Search with Cross-Validation.

### **Technical Stack**
**Programming:** Python (Advanced), MATLAB (Advanced).
**Frameworks & Libraries:** SciPy.optimize, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
**Statistical Analysis:** SmartPLS (SEM-PLS Analysis), SPSS

### **Publication & Recognition**
**Journal:** Accepted in a **Q1 Journal**
**Title:** *Stochastic Multivariate Regression with Feature Engineering for Predictive Analysis of Renewable Energy Consumption Dynamics: A High-Dimensional Quantitative Approach Utilizing the OWID Energy Dataset*.
  **Author Contribution:** 5th Author.
